## University Management System

- A University Management System was designed and implemented for the management of students and faculty, employing
Java, Java Swing, and MySQL.This initiative enhanced administrative processes and increased overall system efficiency.
- Developed a responsive user interface compatible with over 10 platforms and devices, guaranteeing a smooth user
experience across various environments.
- A 40% reduction in administrative processing time led to an annual savings of more than 500 hours. This was
accomplished by successfully integrating backend systems using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), all the while managing data across over ten database tables.
